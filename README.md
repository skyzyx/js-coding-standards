# Parman JavaScript Coding Standards

This guide is an attempt to precisely and thoroughly document all of the idiosyncrasies around how I write JavaScript code, focusing primarily on style, and a little on structure.

## Disclaimer

This is an attempt to document my personal coding style, patterns, and rationale. This is NOT an attempt to tell anybody else how to write code. There is a 100% chance that someone will disagree with me, and that's perfectly OK. This is for me.

If you want to fork this and make edits for yourself or your team, please go right ahead.
