# Editor Settings

* Line-endings should use the `\n` character (`LF`) used by default on Mac OS X and *nix systems.
    * Windows uses `\r\n` (`CRLF`) by default, so make sure that your IDE saves files with Unix-flavored line-endings.

* No trailing whitespace per line.

* A file must always end with an empty line feed.
